For this Problem, we must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.<br/>

o(log n) → Binary Search → Divide and conquer<br/>

<b>Binary Search :</b> In this we will find desired number on a sorted array of numbers, we divide (decrease) the array of numbers(search space), conquer the sub problems by recursively looking at the middle point for our target and splitting until we find our target the base case condition.
